# Azure_VM_UniFi_Controller_Project
A solution for multi-site netork monitoring on an Azure VM, showcasing the strategic migration from a third-party service to an in-house, cost-effective cloud solution.

# Azure Multi-Site UniFi Networks Monitoring Solution

### Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a centralised network monitoring application on an Azure Virtual Machine, moving a third-party service in-house to achieve significant cost savings and improve administrative control.

### The Problem
The company was paying a third-party provider R 1800 per month for a hosted network monitoring service, which was an unnecessary operational cost and limited our administrative flexibility.

### The Solution
I leveraged existing Microsoft partner Azure credits to deploy a new monitoring server on an Azure VM. This move brought the hosting service in-house, eliminated the recurring third-party expense, and allowed for full administrative control of the system.

### Key Technologies Used
- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure Networking (VNet, Subnets, Network Security Groups, Firewall Rules)
- Ubiquiti Network Application (Controller)


### Outcome/Business Impact
Successfully deployed a resilient and scalable cloud-based monitoring solution while **reducing monthly operational costs by R 1800,** leveraging existing company resources to achieve the same functionality for free.
